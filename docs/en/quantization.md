# Quantization

Quantization stores or computes selected tensors at lower precision. In TeleFuser, it is used for model weights, Linear inputs, attention operands, and KV caches. These paths are independent: enabling one does not quantize the entire pipeline.

## Core ideas

`W8A16` means 8-bit weights and 16-bit activations; `W8A8` means both are 8-bit. The accumulator or output can still use BF16 or FP32, so this notation does not describe every tensor in the operation.

For symmetric integer quantization, TeleFuser's offline converter uses:

$$
s = \frac{\max |x|}{127}, \qquad
q = \operatorname{clamp}\left(\operatorname{round}\left(\frac{x}{s}\right), -128, 127\right),
\qquad \hat{x} = s q.
$$

The scale can cover a tensor, an output channel, a token, or a small block. Smaller groups usually reduce error, but require more scale values and more complicated kernels.

| Granularity | TeleFuser example |
| --- | --- |
| Per-tensor | ComfyUI INT8/FP8 conversion |
| Per-output-channel | Offline INT8/FP8 weights and `LinearFP8` weights |
| Per-token | `LinearFP8`, LiveAct, and LingBot FP8 activations |
| Per-block | MXFP and NVFP4 conversion kernels |

## Available paths

| Path | Precision | Entry point |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TorchAO online quantization | FP8 weight-only, W8A16 | `QuantType.TORCHAO_FP8` |
| bitsandbytes online quantization | NF4 weight-only, W4A16 | `QuantType.BNB_NF4` |
| Scaled FP8 checkpoint | FP8 weights and dynamic FP8 activations, W8A8 | `torch_dtype=torch.float8_e4m3fn` |
| Offline checkpoint conversion | INT8, FP8, MXFP4/6/8, or NVFP4 weights | `tools/convert/converter.py` |

`QuantType` also contains formats that are not connected to generic online model loading. An enum value alone is not evidence that a model implements that path.

## Online weight-only quantization

### TorchAO FP8: W8A16

TeleFuser applies TorchAO's `Float8WeightOnlyConfig` to selected `nn.Linear` weights. The weights use symmetric per-output-channel FP8 quantization. This config does not quantize activations, so a BF16 model uses W8A16 rather than W8A8.

The supported TeleFuser models are Wan, Qwen-Image, and LTX transformer blocks. The default filter skips names such as `head`, `time_embedding`, `time_projection`, and `patch_embedding`.

```python
import torch

from telefuser.core.config import QuantConfig, QuantKernelBackend, QuantType
from telefuser.core.module_manager import ModuleManager

quant_config = QuantConfig(
    enabled=True,
    quant_type=QuantType.TORCHAO_FP8,
    kernel_backend=QuantKernelBackend.TORCHAO,
)
manager = ModuleManager(torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16, device="cpu")
manager.load_model(
    dit_paths,
    device="cuda",
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    quant_config=quant_config,
)
```

Run the complete Qwen-Image example with:

```bash
python examples/qwen_image/qwen_image_t2i_telefuser_fp8_h100.py \
  --prompt "A cat playing piano" \
  --output qwen_image_fp8.png
```

Weight-only quantization primarily reduces weight memory traffic. Whether it improves latency depends on the matrix shapes, GPU, TorchAO version, and `torch.compile` behavior.

TorchAO and PyTorch must be version-compatible. Check the
[TorchAO release compatibility table](https://github.com/pytorch/ao/releases) instead of installing the newest
TorchAO release blindly; an import warning or failure means that configuration has not been validated.

### bitsandbytes NF4: W4A16

NF4 uses a non-uniform 4-bit codebook designed for approximately normal weight distributions. TeleFuser replaces selected Linear layers with `bitsandbytes.nn.Linear4bit`, uses BF16 compute, and enables compressed quantization statistics.

```python
quant_config = QuantConfig(
    enabled=True,
    quant_type=QuantType.BNB_NF4,
    kernel_backend=QuantKernelBackend.BITSANDBYTES,
)
```

The full example is `examples/qwen_image/qwen_image_t2i_telefuser_nf4_h100.py`. NF4 usually saves more weight memory than FP8, but 4-bit decoding does not guarantee lower latency.

## Scaled FP8 checkpoints: W8A8

This path is different from TorchAO. A compatible checkpoint already contains E4M3FN weights and a scale for each output channel. `LinearFP8` dynamically quantizes every input row to FP8, then calls a scaled GEMM through `tf_kernel` or vLLM/CUTLASS. The output returns to BF16 or FP16.

For each row, scaled FP8 follows the same absmax idea:

$$
s = \frac{\max |x|}{\operatorname{max}(\mathrm{E4M3FN})}, \qquad
q = \operatorname{cast}_{\mathrm{E4M3FN}}\left(
\operatorname{clamp}\left(\frac{x}{s}, f_{\min}, f_{\max}\right)\right).
$$

Load only a checkpoint that follows TeleFuser's expected weight and scale layout:

```python
manager.load_model(
    fp8_checkpoint,
    device="cuda",
    torch_dtype=torch.float8_e4m3fn,
)
```

Changing `torch_dtype` does not turn an arbitrary BF16 checkpoint into a scaled FP8 checkpoint. Start from the supplied Qwen-Image or Wan FP8 examples.

## Offline conversion

The converter quantizes selected two-dimensional weights and writes the scales beside them. It creates an artifact; it does not add an inference kernel.

```bash
python tools/convert/converter.py \
  --source /path/to/source \
  --output /path/to/output \
  --model_type wan_dit \
  --quantized \
  --linear_dtype fp8 \
  --non_linear_dtype torch.bfloat16 \
  --single_file
```

`--linear_dtype` accepts `int8`, `fp8`, `mxfp4`, `mxfp6`, `mxfp8`, and `nvfp4`.

- `int8` and `fp8` use one absmax scale per output row. ComfyUI mode uses one scale per tensor.
- MXFP4/6/8 use 32-value blocks and E8M0 scales through `lightx2v_kernel`.
- NVFP4 packs two values per byte and uses one E4M3 scale per 16 values plus a tensor-wide global scale.
- Non-quantized tensors are converted to `--non_linear_dtype`.

The default scale keys are `<weight>_scale`; NVFP4 also writes `<weight>_global_scale`. MXFP and NVFP4 conversion
requires CUDA and `lightx2v_kernel`. TeleFuser's generic loader does not execute these artifacts; a matching consumer
must implement the same layout and GEMM.

## Other quantized data paths

- **LiveAct FP8:** wraps Linear layers with vLLM-style dynamic W8A8 GEMM. Weights are cached in FP8 and activations are quantized per token.
- **LingBot-Video MoE FP8:** quantizes expert weights per output channel and routed activations per row, then uses `torch._scaled_mm`.
- **SageAttention:** all three TeleFuser variants quantize Q/K to INT8. `2_8_16` uses FP16 P/V, while `2_8_8` and its SM90 variant use FP8 P/V. These kernels do not change model weights.
- **LiveAct FP8 KV cache:** stores K/V as E4M3FN with one FP32 scale per last-dimension vector, then dequantizes to the requested attention dtype on load.

## Validation

Use the same prompt, input, seed, scheduler, and inference steps as the BF16 baseline. Check all of the following:

1. The log reports a non-zero number of converted Linear layers.
2. Optional backends pass a real `torch.inference_mode()` forward; a successful import alone is insufficient.
3. Peak loading memory and steady-state VRAM are measured separately.
4. Latency is measured after warmup with CUDA synchronization or CUDA events.
5. Generated images or videos are compared with the baseline; successful execution alone is not an accuracy test.

For operator comparisons, useful error measures are:

$$
E_{\max} = \max |y_q-y|, \qquad
E_{\mathrm{rel}} = \frac{\lVert y_q-y \rVert_2}{\lVert y \rVert_2}.
$$

Relevant tests include `tests/unit/quantize/test_quantized_linear.py` and `tests/unit/models/test_lingbot_video_moe.py`.
