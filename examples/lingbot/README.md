# LingBot-World Examples

Offline image-to-video and interactive WebRTC streaming generation for LingBot-World-Fast (v1) and LingBot-World
v2. Both variants use the shared causal-fast streaming engine; their checkpoint layout and PPL defaults differ.

## Model Directory

Both offline examples require the Wan2.2 I2V base model. v1 and v2 use separate LingBot checkpoint directories:

```text
${TF_MODEL_ZOO_PATH}/
├── Wan2.2-I2V-A14B/
└── lingbot/
    ├── lingbot-world-fast/
    └── lingbot-world-v2-14b-causal-fast/
        └── transformers/
```

Set the model root before running the example:

```bash
export TF_MODEL_ZOO_PATH=/path/to/model_zoo
```

## Files

### lingbot_world_fast_image_to_video_h100.py

Offline generation and stream-server entry point for LingBot-World-Fast with camera control.

Default configuration:

- Resolution: `480p`
- Output frames: `81`
- Frame rate: `16 FPS`
- Chunk size: `3` latent frames
- Seed: `42`
- Control mode: `cam`
- Attention backend: `SAGE_ATTN_2_8_8_SM90`
- Default input: `examples/data/lingbot_world_fast/image.jpg`
- Default control directory: `examples/data/lingbot_world_fast/`
- Default output: `work_dirs/lingbot_world_fast_i2v_<gpu_num>gpu.mp4`

### lingbot_world_v2_image_to_video_h100.py

Offline generation and stream-server entry point for camera-controlled v2. The default is 77 frames at 16 FPS: 20 latent frames, exactly five
complete chunks of four. With complete chunk streaming, 81 output frames cannot be represented by `chunk_size=4`.
The v2 checkpoint only supports camera control and uses its PPL-configured SageAttention SM90 backend, local attention, sink size,
and timesteps.

```bash
python examples/lingbot/lingbot_world_v2_image_to_video_h100.py \
    --gpu_num 4 \
    --model_root "${TF_MODEL_ZOO_PATH}/Wan2.2-I2V-A14B" \
    --v2_model_root "${TF_MODEL_ZOO_PATH}/lingbot/lingbot-world-v2-14b-causal-fast/transformers"
```

## Usage

### Four H100 GPUs

The recommended configuration uses four H100 GPUs with Ulysses sequence parallelism for DiT inference:

```bash
python examples/lingbot/lingbot_world_fast_image_to_video_h100.py \
    --gpu_num 4 \
    --model_root "${TF_MODEL_ZOO_PATH}/Wan2.2-I2V-A14B" \
    --fast_model_root "${TF_MODEL_ZOO_PATH}/lingbot/lingbot-world-fast"
```

### Single H100 GPU

```bash
python examples/lingbot/lingbot_world_fast_image_to_video_h100.py \
    --gpu_num 1 \
    --model_root "${TF_MODEL_ZOO_PATH}/Wan2.2-I2V-A14B" \
    --fast_model_root "${TF_MODEL_ZOO_PATH}/lingbot/lingbot-world-fast"
```

### Custom Input and Output

`--action_path` accepts a directory containing `poses.npy` and, in action-control mode, `action.npy`.
Pass the camera calibration file separately with `--intrinsics-path`. If it was calibrated at a resolution other
than `832x480`, also pass `--intrinsics-width` and `--intrinsics-height`; the pipeline transforms the calibration to
the generated frame size.

```bash
python examples/lingbot/lingbot_world_fast_image_to_video_h100.py \
    --gpu_num 4 \
    --model_root "${TF_MODEL_ZOO_PATH}/Wan2.2-I2V-A14B" \
    --fast_model_root "${TF_MODEL_ZOO_PATH}/lingbot/lingbot-world-fast" \
    --image_path /path/to/input.jpg \
    --action_path /path/to/camera_control \
    --intrinsics-path /path/to/intrinsics.npy \
    --intrinsics-width 1920 \
    --intrinsics-height 1080 \
    --prompt "A cinematic scene with smooth camera motion" \
    --resolution 720p \
    --fps 16 \
    --seed 42 \
    --output work_dirs/lingbot_world_fast_custom.mp4
```

### Repository-Provided Input

The repository includes an image, poses, and intrinsics that can be used directly. Omit the input, control, and
output options to use these defaults:

```bash
python examples/lingbot/lingbot_world_fast_image_to_video_h100.py \
    --gpu_num 4 \
    --model_root "${TF_MODEL_ZOO_PATH}/Wan2.2-I2V-A14B" \
    --fast_model_root "${TF_MODEL_ZOO_PATH}/lingbot/lingbot-world-fast"
```

## Notes

- Offline frame counts are fixed in each example's `PPL_CONFIG`: v1 uses 81 frames (seven complete chunks of
  three latent frames) and v2 uses 77 frames (five complete chunks of four latent frames).
- `--gpu_num` must not exceed the number of GPUs visible to the process. For example, set
  `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3` to select four devices.
- The example explicitly closes its parallel workers on exit. If the process is forcibly terminated, check for
  residual `spawn_main` child processes.

## Real-Time Streaming

The same examples expose both offline generation and a stream-server `get_service()` entry point. Configure topology
through `PPL_CONFIG`; `stream-serve --gpu-num` is passed to `get_service(gpu_num=...)`. Use
`CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` to select the physical devices. Do not use `torchrun` because TeleFuser creates workers internally.

### Scheduler and Stage Placement

LingBot offline and stream-server execution share the actor-based streaming scheduler.
The bundled examples place VAE encode and decode on GPU 0, while direct
`LingBotWorldFastPipelineConfig` users may set `vae_encode_config` and
`vae_decode_config` independently. The scheduler does not infer a resource
group from overlapping device IDs, so VAE encode, DiT, and VAE decode may
overlap on one GPU. If a topology runs out of memory, move stages to different
devices.

See the [streaming scheduler guide](../../docs/en/stream_scheduler.md) for
architecture, metric definitions, and lifecycle guarantees.

### Tested GPU and Duration Limits

The global KV cache grows with the requested frame count even when FSDP is enabled. The following 832x480 limits
were verified on H100 80 GB GPUs with `chunk_size=3`, `16 FPS`, and `sample_shift=10.0`:

| GPUs | Duration selected in the page | Frame count | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2 H100 | 10 seconds | 153 | Passed |
| 2 H100 | 20 seconds | 321 | CUDA OOM while allocating KV cache |
| 4 H100 | 20 seconds | 321 | Passed, 27/27 chunks |

The four-GPU 20-second test used FSDP and Ulysses degree 4. Peak memory was approximately 58.6 GiB on GPU 0 and
41.6 GiB on GPUs 1-3. These are tested values, not universal limits; other resolutions and concurrent GPU users
change the available capacity.

### Start a Local TURN Server for VS Code Remote SSH

VS Code forwards TCP ports. For a laptop browser accessing a remote host, use TURN over TCP and force relay mode.
The following development-only coturn command binds to loopback and uses a small relay range:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y coturn

turnserver -n -m 1 \
    --listening-ip=127.0.0.1 \
    --relay-ip=127.0.0.1 \
    --listening-port=3478 \
    --min-port=49160 --max-port=49200 \
    --user=telefuser:telefuser-turn \
    --realm=telefuser.local \
    --fingerprint --lt-cred-mech \
    --no-tls --no-dtls --no-cli \
    --allow-loopback-peers \
    --simple-log --log-file=/tmp/telefuser-turn.log
```

Keep this command running in its own terminal. `--allow-loopback-peers` is required here because both TeleFuser and
coturn run on the same remote host; do not copy this loopback configuration to an internet-facing production TURN
server. Verify the credentials and TCP allocation locally:

```bash
turnutils_uclient -t -y -c \
    -u telefuser -w telefuser-turn -p 3478 127.0.0.1
```

### Start the Four-GPU LingBot Service

```bash
TF_MODEL_ZOO_PATH=/path/to/model_zoo \
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 \
TELEFUSER_TURN_SERVER='turn:127.0.0.1:3478?transport=tcp' \
TELEFUSER_TURN_USERNAME=telefuser \
TELEFUSER_TURN_CREDENTIAL=telefuser-turn \
telefuser stream-serve examples/lingbot/lingbot_world_fast_image_to_video_h100.py \
    --gpu-num 4 -p 8088 --host 0.0.0.0 --skip-validation
```

Wait for `Starting stream server on 0.0.0.0:8088`, then verify readiness:

```bash
curl --noproxy '*' http://127.0.0.1:8088/v1/service/health
```

### Start the Browser Demo

Run the demo on the remote TeleFuser host. It proxies signaling requests to port 8088, so the laptop browser does
not need direct access to 8088.

```bash
python examples/stream_server/webrtc_bidirectional_demo.py \
    --server-url http://127.0.0.1:8088 \
    --port 8091 \
    --turn-url 'turn:localhost:3478?transport=tcp' \
    --turn-username telefuser \
    --turn-credential telefuser-turn \
    --force-turn-relay \
    --ice-gather-timeout-ms 30000 \
    --no-open
```

In the VS Code **Ports** panel, forward these remote TCP ports:

| Remote port | Required local port | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `8091` | Any available port | Demo page and proxied SDP/session HTTP requests |
| `3478` | `3478` | Browser TURN-over-TCP connection used by `turn:localhost:3478` |

Do not forward 8088 when proxying is enabled. Port 3478 must keep local port 3478 unless `--turn-url` is changed to
the alternative local port. Open the forwarded 8091 URL shown by VS Code using `http://`, then hard-refresh the
page after restarting the demo. Do not forward coturn's `49160-49200` relay range through VS Code: browser relay
traffic remains inside the forwarded TURN TCP connection, while that range is used remotely between coturn and the
WebRTC peer.

If you connect with a normal SSH client instead of VS Code Remote SSH, run this command in a separate terminal on
the laptop. Replace `USER` and `SERVER_HOST` with the SSH login used for the server:

```bash
ssh -N \
    -o ExitOnForwardFailure=yes \
    -o ServerAliveInterval=30 \
    -L 8091:127.0.0.1:8091 \
    -L 3478:127.0.0.1:3478 \
    USER@SERVER_HOST
```

Keep the command running and open `http://localhost:8091`. Add `-p SSH_PORT` or `-i /path/to/private_key` when the
server requires a non-default SSH port or identity file. To obtain an interactive shell from the same connection,
omit `-N`. If local port 8091 is occupied, change only the first mapping, for example
`-L 18091:127.0.0.1:8091`, and open `http://localhost:18091`.

If local port 3478 is occupied, map another local port such as `-L 13478:127.0.0.1:3478` and change the browser demo
argument to `--turn-url 'turn:localhost:13478?transport=tcp'`. The server-side
`TELEFUSER_TURN_SERVER='turn:127.0.0.1:3478?transport=tcp'` remains unchanged.

### Run the Demo Entirely on One Machine

If both the browser and the GPU service run on the same physical machine, neither coturn nor SSH forwarding is
needed. This includes a browser opened directly on the workstation or through its remote desktop, VNC, or noVNC
session. It does not include an SSH shell on the server with the browser still running on a laptop.

Start the service in the first terminal with TURN variables explicitly removed:

```bash
env -u TELEFUSER_TURN_SERVER \
    -u TELEFUSER_TURN_USERNAME \
    -u TELEFUSER_TURN_CREDENTIAL \
    TF_MODEL_ZOO_PATH=/path/to/model_zoo \
    CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 \
    telefuser stream-serve examples/lingbot/lingbot_world_fast_image_to_video_h100.py \
    --gpu-num 4 -p 8088 --host 127.0.0.1 --skip-validation
```

Start the demo in a second terminal without `--turn-url`, TURN credentials, or `--force-turn-relay`:

```bash
env -u TELEFUSER_TURN_SERVER \
    -u TELEFUSER_TURN_USERNAME \
    -u TELEFUSER_TURN_CREDENTIAL \
    python examples/stream_server/webrtc_bidirectional_demo.py \
    --server-url http://127.0.0.1:8088 \
    --port 8091 \
    --no-open
```

Open `http://localhost:8091` in the browser on that machine.

Select the initial image in the browser before connecting; it is sent directly with the WebRTC offer. Real-time
camera poses come from live controls. When the request omits camera intrinsics, the service centers the principal
point on the selected image and uses its width as both focal lengths, preserving LingBot's default horizontal field
of view for square, landscape, and portrait inputs. Requests with calibrated intrinsics should also send
`intrinsics_width` and `intrinsics_height` so the service can transform them from calibration pixels to output pixels.

### Camera Controls

The page has separate translation and rotation pads:

| Input | Camera operation |
| --- | --- |
| `W` or `↑` | Move forward |
| `S` or `↓` | Move backward |
| `A` | Strafe left |
| `D` | Strafe right |
| `J` | Yaw left |
| `L` | Yaw right |
| `I` | Pitch up |
| `K` | Pitch down |

Multiple keys can be held together, for example `W+J`. Move/strafe steps default to `0.05` per video frame;
yaw/pitch steps default to `2°` per video frame, with pitch limited to `±85°`. Camera pose and pitch accumulate
across chunks. The browser sends the complete held-key snapshot; the service retains only the newest pending
short-press snapshot, so stale taps cannot override newer input. Releasing all keys stops requesting new chunks, and
WebRTC repeats the most recent frame while idle. **Release Controls** clears held and pending keys without changing
the accumulated pose; **Reset Camera Pose** explicitly clears keys and returns the pose to identity.

Every output chunk includes its immutable `applied_controls` snapshot. Its `MOVE`/`ROTATE` HUD is rendered from that
same snapshot, so the indicators describe the translation and rotation that actually generated the displayed frames.

#### Camera Motion Integration

The service maintains a camera-to-world matrix and a scalar accumulated pitch for each session. Every video-frame
integration step first updates yaw and pitch, then derives horizontal movement directions from the new camera
rotation:

```text
R_new   = Ry(yaw_delta) @ R_old @ Rx(pitch_delta)
forward = normalize([R_new[0, 2], 0, R_new[2, 2]])
right   = normalize([R_new[0, 0], 0, R_new[2, 0]])
t_new   = t_old + forward_or_backward + left_or_right
```

Yaw is applied around the world Y axis, pitch around the local camera X axis, and translation is projected onto the
world XZ plane. Pitch therefore changes the viewing direction without making forward motion fly upward. Simultaneous
translation keys are added directly, so diagonal motion is faster than a single-axis move.

The Wan VAE has a temporal compression factor of four. The service consequently performs four video-frame camera
steps between adjacent latent poses. With the default `chunk_size=3`, holding `W` produces the following positions
for the first two chunks:

```text
first chunk:  z = [0.0, 0.2, 0.4]
next chunk:   previous z = 0.4, current z = [0.6, 0.8, 1.0]
```

The previous chunk's final pose is carried across the boundary before framewise relative poses are computed. This
keeps the first motion in every subsequent chunk continuous instead of resetting it to the identity pose. Control is
sampled when a chunk is submitted; releasing or changing a key does not alter control chunks that were already
submitted or prefetched.

#### From Camera Poses to DiT Control

The accumulated absolute poses are converted into frame-to-frame relative poses. Relative translation is normalized
by the largest translation norm in that control chunk, matching the current LingBot preprocessing. As a result,
`control_move_step` controls the accumulated camera path but does not necessarily scale the model-visible translation
strength proportionally for constant-speed motion. Real-time control then multiplies the normalized translation by
`control_translation_scale` (default `3.0`), so a non-zero single-direction step has model-visible magnitude `3`
rather than `1`. Rotation deltas are not normalized in this way.

The relative poses and transformed camera intrinsics define a ray origin and ray direction for every output pixel.
Camera-control mode concatenates them into six-channel Plücker ray features, rearranges each spatial VAE-stride block
onto the latent grid, and sends the resulting tensor through the DiT camera-control embedding. Camera control does
not pass through the VAE; only the reference image and generated video use the VAE encode/decode paths.

### Troubleshooting

- **Blank 8091 page:** confirm the demo process is listening, open the exact forwarded URL from the VS Code Ports
  panel using `http://`, and hard-refresh. The demo uses a threaded HTTP server so VS Code probe connections do not
  block page requests.
- **No relay candidate:** confirm local port 3478 maps to remote 3478, the TURN credentials match, and the demo log
  shows `iceTransportPolicy=relay`. Browser logs should report at least one `typ=relay` candidate.
- **Static preview:** inspect the DataChannel log for `control_state` and `applying_direction_control`. If the server
  logged CUDA OOM, restart the service because a failed parallel worker cannot process another session.
- **Session already active:** click **Stop** or delete it with
  `curl -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:8088/v1/stream/webrtc/<session_id>`.
- **Residual workers after a forced exit:** terminate stale `spawn_main` processes before restarting.
