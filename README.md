TeleFuser is a high-performance runtime for world model inference and multimodal generation. It is designed for continuous, low-latency, stateful visual generation workloads such as real-time world models, interactive agents, speech-driven animation, and streaming visual systems.

## Why TeleFuser

Real-time world models need a different runtime profile: continuous execution, streaming output, bidirectional interaction, stateful sessions, long-context efficiency, and stable performance under concurrency. TeleFuser focuses on those runtime problems directly.

The project treats a world model as more than a function that returns a single clip. It provides the infrastructure needed to run a model as a continuously updated system that can receive input, keep state, and emit frames progressively.

## What TeleFuser Provides

- **World-model-oriented runtime**: Support for continuous video generation, interactive sessions, and bidirectional control loops.
- **AI Dev First interfaces**: Pipelines can publish `PIPELINE_CONTRACT` / `PIPELINE_MANIFEST` metadata so agents and services can discover tasks, inputs, and parameters programmatically.
- **Asynchronous pipeline scheduling**: Stage-based execution with request isolation, resource locking, and parallel stage groups.
- **Streaming transport**: WebRTC-based streaming with media tracks plus DataChannel control for real-time inference.
- **Scalable GPU runtime**: Multi-GPU execution with tensor parallelism, sequence parallelism, Ray-based deployment, and distributed worker orchestration.
- **Inference optimization stack**: Triton kernels, optimized attention backends, quantization, offload, and feature caching.
- **Unified serving**: Local Python API, `telefuser serve` for task APIs, and `telefuser stream-serve` for continuous streaming services.

## World Model Inference Focus

TeleFuser is built around the runtime requirements that world models expose in production:

- **Continuous execution instead of one-shot calls**: stream frames as they are produced instead of waiting for full completion.
- **Interactive control**: accept prompts, controls, images, audio, or action signals while a session is active.
- **Stateful sessions**: keep runtime state across chunks rather than rebuilding the full pipeline every step.
- **Low first-frame latency**: expose partial outputs quickly through async scheduling and streaming transport.
- **Long-horizon efficiency**: reduce memory pressure for long videos and repeated denoising through sequence parallelism, offload, and caching.

Today that maps to concrete capabilities in this repo, including:

- bidirectional WebRTC sessions for `LingBot-World-Fast`
- speech-to-video generation for `LiveAct`
- streaming video processing for `FlashVSR`
- long-form and continuation workflows for `LongCat-Video`
- batch and async video generation for `WanVideo`, `HunyuanVideo`, and `LTX Video`

## Quick Start

### Install

```bash
pip install -e .
```

For development:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

For WebRTC streaming:

```bash
pip install -e ".[webrtc]"
```

### 1. Batch Video Inference

```python
from telefuser.pipelines.wan_video.wan21_video import Wan21VideoPipeline
import torch

pipe = Wan21VideoPipeline.from_pretrained(
    model_id_or_path="Wan-AI/Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B",
    device="cuda",
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
)

video = pipe(
    prompt="A cat playing piano",
    num_frames=81,
    height=480,
    width=832,
)
```

### 2. Real-Time World Model Demo

TeleFuser includes a bidirectional WebRTC demo for `LingBot-World-Fast`.

```bash
export LINGBOT_WORLD_CHECKPOINT_DIR=/path/to/LingBot-World

telefuser stream-serve examples/stream_server/stream_lingbot_world_fast.py \
  -p 8088 \
  --skip-validation

python examples/stream_server/webrtc_bidirectional_demo.py \
  --server-url http://localhost:8088 \
  --image-path /path/to/input.png
```

This starts a continuous session where the client sends control messages over a WebRTC DataChannel and receives generated video frames over media tracks.

### 3. Batch Service Mode

```bash
telefuser serve examples/wan_video/wan22_14b_text_to_video_service.py --port 8000
```

TeleFuser exposes:

- native task APIs under `/v1/tasks/*`
- OpenAI-compatible image and video APIs under `/v1/images` and `/v1/videos`
- service metadata that reflects the pipeline contract

See [docs/en/service.md](docs/en/service.md) for full API details.

## Serving Modes

### `telefuser serve`

Use this mode for request-response inference with task management, standard REST APIs, and service metadata.

- good fit for batch text-to-video, image-to-video, image generation, and super-resolution
- supports pipeline contracts for structured parameter exposure
- supports OpenAI-compatible routes for easier client integration

### `telefuser stream-serve`

Use this mode for continuous streaming workloads.

- server-push WebRTC for progressive video output
- bidirectional WebRTC for interactive control loops
- useful for real-time world models, speech-driven generation, and streaming media pipelines

See [docs/en/stream_server.md](docs/en/stream_server.md) for stream protocol details.

## AI Dev First Runtime

TeleFuser is designed so pipelines are understandable not only to human developers, but also to automated systems and agents.

- `PIPELINE_CONTRACT` and `PIPELINE_MANIFEST` define supported tasks, required file inputs, defaults, and user-facing parameters.
- the service layer uses those contracts to expose machine-readable metadata
- the same pipeline can be used locally, through REST APIs, or through streaming services

This is the core of the project's "AI Dev First" direction: standardize runtime behavior so orchestration systems can discover and use pipelines without reverse-engineering internal code paths.

## Architecture

TeleFuser uses a layered runtime architecture that maps cleanly to the repository structure:

1. **Access layer**: FastAPI task APIs and WebRTC streaming entrypoints.
2. **Service and scheduling layer**: request routing, task management, stream sessions, and orchestration.
3. **Pipeline abstraction layer**: stage-based pipelines with async execution, request isolation, and resource locks.
4. **Model and optimization layer**: model loading, attention selection, quantization, offload, LoRA, and cache integration.
5. **Execution backend layer**: optimized ops, Triton kernels, and device-specific implementations.

## Runtime Capabilities

- **Async pipeline scheduling**: run independent stages concurrently and gate shared resources with lock groups.
- **Distributed inference**: tensor parallelism, sequence parallelism, Ray-based multi-GPU deployment, and pipeline-scale orchestration.
- **Attention backends**: Torch SDPA, FlashAttention, SageAttention, sparse attention variants, and other configurable implementations.
- **Feature caching**: `AdaTaylorCache` accelerates supported diffusion models with calibrated skip/reuse logic.
- **Memory optimization**: CPU offload, weight reuse, and runtime-aware loading strategies for large video models.
- **Quantization**: FP8 and INT8-related runtime support where the model/backend path allows it.
- **Streaming output**: progressive frame delivery over WebRTC with optional audio tracks.

## Known Limitations

- `AdaTaylorCache` is only calibrated for selected model families.
- `torch.compile` support is still experimental in parts of the stack.
- Some optimized paths require specific GPU architectures and CUDA versions.
- World-model examples such as `LingBot-World-Fast` require external checkpoints and environment setup.
- Multi-machine deployment exists in the architecture but may require project-specific integration and validation.
