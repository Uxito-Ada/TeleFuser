TeleFuser is a high-performance runtime for world model inference and multimodal generation. It is designed for continuous, low-latency, stateful visual generation workloads such as real-time world models, speech-driven animation, and streaming visual systems.

## News 📰

- ✨ **2026-07-06**: Added external **CacheSeek** latent cache integration for service-mode cross-request reuse. Cache hits can skip the first N denoising steps; the Wan2.2 cache-enabled service example snapshots `[5, 10, 15, 20, 25]` by default. See [docs/en/latent_cache.md](docs/en/latent_cache.md).

## Why TeleFuser

Most open-source inference stacks are optimized for one of three cases:

- one-shot image generation
- offline video generation
- general LLM serving

Real-time world models need a different runtime profile: continuous execution, streaming output, bidirectional interaction, stateful sessions, long-context efficiency, and stable performance under concurrency. TeleFuser focuses on those runtime problems directly.

The project treats a world model as more than a function that returns a single clip. It provides the infrastructure needed to run a model as a continuously updated system that can receive input, keep state, and emit frames progressively.

## What TeleFuser Provides

- **World-model-oriented runtime**: Support for continuous video generation, interactive sessions, and bidirectional control loops.
- **ADF (AI Dev First)**: Repository layers, pipeline contracts, examples, and docs are structured for coding agents to discover capabilities, follow project conventions, and extend pipelines efficiently.
- **Asynchronous pipeline orchestration**: Optional stage-based execution with request state tracking, resource locks, and parallel stage groups.
- **Streaming transport**: WebRTC-based streaming with media tracks plus DataChannel control for real-time inference.
- **Scalable GPU runtime**: Multi-GPU execution with tensor parallelism, sequence parallelism, optional Ray workers, and distributed service replicas.
- **Inference optimization stack**: Triton kernels, optimized attention backends, quantization, offload, feature caching, and CacheSeek latent cache integration.
- **Unified serving**: Local Python API, `telefuser serve` for task APIs, and `telefuser stream-serve` for continuous streaming services.

## Quick Start

### Install

```bash
pip install -e .
```

For development:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

WebRTC streaming support is included in the default installation through `aiortc`.

### 1. Batch Video Inference

```python
from telefuser.pipelines.wan_video.wan21_video import Wan21VideoPipeline
import torch

pipe = Wan21VideoPipeline.from_pretrained(
    model_id_or_path="Wan-AI/Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B",
    device="cuda",
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
)

video = pipe(
    prompt="A cat playing piano",
    num_frames=81,
    height=480,
    width=832,
)
```

### 2. Real-Time World Model Demo

TeleFuser includes a bidirectional WebRTC demo for `LingBot-World-Fast`.

```bash
# Set TF_MODEL_ZOO_PATH and PPL_CONFIG["parallelism"] in:
# examples/lingbot/stream_lingbot_world_fast.py

telefuser stream-serve examples/lingbot/stream_lingbot_world_fast.py \
  -p 8088 \
  --skip-validation

python examples/stream_server/webrtc_bidirectional_demo.py \
  --server-url http://localhost:8088 \
  --image-path /path/to/input.png
```

This starts a continuous session where the client sends control messages over a WebRTC DataChannel and receives generated video frames over media tracks.

### 3. Batch Service Mode

```bash
telefuser serve examples/wan_video/wan22_14b_text_to_video_h100.py --task t2v --port 8000
```

TeleFuser exposes:

- native task APIs under `/v1/tasks/*`
- OpenAI-compatible image and video APIs under `/v1/images` and `/v1/videos`
- service metadata that reflects the pipeline contract

See [docs/en/service.md](docs/en/service.md) for full API details.

## Architecture

TeleFuser uses a layered runtime architecture that maps cleanly to the repository structure:

1. **Access layer**: FastAPI task APIs and WebRTC streaming entrypoints.
2. **Service layer**: request routing, task management, stream sessions, replica pools, and integration with pipeline execution.
3. **Pipeline abstraction layer**: model-specific `BasePipeline` / `BaseStage` components, with optional orchestrator support for async stage execution, request state tracking, and resource locks.
4. **Model and optimization layer**: model loading, attention selection, quantization, offload, LoRA, and cache integration.
5. **Execution backend layer**: optimized ops, Triton kernels, and device-specific implementations.

## Known Limitations

- `AdaTaylorCache` is only calibrated for selected model families.
- `torch.compile` support is still experimental in parts of the stack.
- Some optimized paths require specific GPU architectures and CUDA versions.
- World-model examples such as `LingBot-World-Fast` require external checkpoints and environment setup.
- Multi-machine deployment exists in the architecture but may require project-specific integration and validation.
