"""Pipeline Parallel P2P Communication Module.

This module provides point-to-point communication utilities for Pipeline Parallelism,
enabling efficient communication between pipeline stages.

Pipeline Parallelism Algorithm:
1. Model is split across multiple stages (each GPU holds a subset of layers)
2. Stage 0 processes input, sends intermediate activations to Stage 1
3. Each stage receives from previous, processes, sends to next
4. Final stage produces output

Communication Pattern:
- Each stage sends to next rank, receives from previous rank
- Uses async send/recv for communication overlapping
- Supports send_recv for simultaneous communication
